# Kuro Player User Manual

## Introduction

Kuro Player is a free and open source, cross-platform, **libmpv** based multimedia player.
Its simple design reflects the idea for an uncluttered, simple, and enjoyable environment for watching tv shows.

## Features

### Playlist

The playlist is automatically populated by loading the files in the directory of the loaded file. If a folder is opened by drag and dropping it, the files in the immediate folder directory will be automatically populated (not including subdirectories).

### Gestures

Using a mouse or a touch screen, you can click and drag on the video to change playback.
Clicking and dragging left/right will seek backwards/forwards.
Clicking and dragging up/down will increase/decrease volume.
Gesture support can be disabled under Preferences if desired.

### Screenshots

The screenshot template is passed into mpv as `screenshot-template` (see mpv's manual for more info). If the screenshot dialog is hidden by unchecking the `Always show this dialog` option, the dialog can be restored by setting `kuro-player/screenshotDialog` to true in the settings file.

### Recent Files

Your recently viewed files are stored in settings for easy access. It is located at the bottom of the file under `[kuro-player] -> recent`. To store more recently viewed files, set the `[kuro-player] -> maxRecent` value and the list will trim itself accordingly.

## Settings

On Windows, the config files are saved with the executable in an ini file `kuro-player.ini`.
On Linux, they are saved in the Qt location `~/.config/kuro-player.ini`.

	# Below are the keys and comments specify setting details

Note that the `[mpv]` section is using mpv's options. See mpv's manual for a list of valid options.


## Commands

The command-line is handled on an argument basis by splitting commands up by spaces and getting more and more specific. The major command differentiation is between mpv and kuro-player.

Kuro-Player commands should be prefixed with `kuro` while mpv commands are prefixed with `mpv`. eg. `kuro quit` vs `mpv quit`  Both will quit but one told mpv to quit (which then ended kuro), while the other told kuro to quit (which ended mpv).

In general you'll want to use any available kuro-player command before you use an mpv command; this is because some aspects either are kuro-player specific or handle certain issues. For example: `kuro volume +5` vs `mpv volume +5`; kuro-player will adjust the volume even if no video is playing and update mpv accordingly when it starts up; mpv volume will only work if a file is playing.

The following is a list of the available `kuro` commands (for `mpv` commands see mpv's manual):

	new                             # creates a new instance of kuro-player
	open_location                   # shows the open location dialog
	open_clipboard                  # opens the clipboard
	show_in_folder                  # shows the current file in folder
	add_subtitles                   # add subtitles dialog
	screenshot [subtitles]          # take a screenshot (with subs if specified)
	media_info                      # toggles media info state
	stop                            # stops the current playback

## Translations

### To add a new translation

1. Update your local repo to make sure everything is up to date.
2. Open `src/translations.pri` with your favorite text editor.
3. Add a new line that says `translations/kuro-player_{lang-code}.ts` in the format that exists (all lines except the last require a `\`).
4. Run `./configure CONFIG+=begin_translations` to prepare your translation file.
5. Go to `src/translations/` and you will now find your language's `.ts` file.
6. Open the `.ts` file with Qt Linguist and proceed to translate into your language.
7. Upon completion of the translation, run `./configure CONFIG+=update_translations`. This will trim the .ts file to the minimum required information for release.

### To update an existing translation

1. Update your local repo to make sure everything is up to date.
2. Run `./configure CONFIG+=begin_translations` to regenerate the `.ts` files.
3. Make your changes.
4. Run `./configure CONFIG+=update_translations` to trim the `.ts` files.

If you want to submit a translation, you can create a git pull request or send it to us through irc.
